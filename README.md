# Unhandled Exception During Garbage Collection in Python

This repository demonstrates a rather uncommon Python error: an unhandled exception occurring during garbage collection.  The example shows a function that handles `ZeroDivisionError` and `TypeError` but could still throw an unhandled exception during garbage collection if not completely handling all possible exceptions.  The solution highlights techniques to improve exception handling and potentially prevent this type of error.

## Problem

Standard try-except blocks might not handle all exceptions, especially those that emerge during Python's garbage collection process.   This often happens due to unexpected interactions between objects' destructors and memory management.   The resulting exception may not be directly visible within the main function but will crash the program later, making debugging difficult.

## Solution

The solution introduces more robust exception handling.  While a complete list of possible exceptions during garbage collection isn't guaranteed, a more general exception handling approach might help prevent the crash.   Note that even this more generalized approach may not completely solve this specific problem in all situations.
